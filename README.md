# Check_duplicate_images_using_MLandDL_Techniques

### Project Objective:
The objective of the project is to identify and remove duplicate images in the dataset using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. To achieve this, clustering algorithms are employed to group similar images into respective clusters, allowing for the efficient removal of duplicates. This process results in a clean and organized dataset, facilitating better future decision-making.

### Libraries and Algorithms:
Numpy, Keras, Matplotlib, cv2, Dbscan, Kmeans

## Kmean Clustering Algorithm:
- Use Elbow Method to identify the optimal numbers of clusters in the dataset.
- Running clustering algorithm with optimal k value and create a cluster directory  to store images in their respective clusters.
