# Check_duplicate_images_using_MLandDL_Techniques

### Project Objective
The objective of the project is to identify and remove duplicate images in the dataset using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. To achieve this, clustering algorithms are employed to group similar images into respective clusters, allowing for the efficient removal of duplicates. This process results in a clean and organized dataset, facilitating better future decision-making.
